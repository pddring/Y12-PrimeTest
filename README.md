# PrimeTest
This program will find out how many prime numbers there are in a given range of integers.
It will ask you to enter a minimum and maximum number then ask you how many threads the program should run on.

Your job is to investigate the optimimum number of threads for running this program on your computer.

## Instructions:
1) Compile and run the code
You should see something like this;

1) Run the program multiple times, recording the time it takes to find all the prime numbers from 0 to 10,000,000 when you vary the number of threads
2) Plot the time taken against the number of threads to see the optimimum number of threads for best performance
3) Compare the optimimum number of threads with the specifications (e.g. number of cores/threads) on your computer
